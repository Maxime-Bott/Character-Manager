## About the project ? 

Through **Character manager** project, we've learned to contact an API in order to make an entire CRUD [Create - READ - Update - Delete] using Javascript vanilla. The purpose was to have the possibility to :
- **See** the characters created by others  **_GET_**
- **Create** his own character **_POST_**
- **Edit** characters (any of them) **_PUT_**
- **Delete** characters (any of them) **_DELETE_**

The project can be considered as the **JAVASCRIPT** **_CONSOLIDATION_** project of our promo **Jepsen 4.27 (2021)**.

## A word about technologies  we used : 

- **Javascript** : The entire CRUD is made in JS. Thanks to JS, we've got a fonctional and dynamic website.
- **Materialize** : CSS Framework. **_Created and designed by Google, Material Design is a design language_** ([Materialize  website](https://materializecss.com/)).
